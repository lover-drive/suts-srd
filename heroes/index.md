*The world is falling apart and various Dark forces and evil people want to see it in ruins. The world needs mighty heroes that will stand tall and defend it from endless calamities.
You are these heroes. At least, as long as you don’t fall for the temptations of Darkness.*

Character creation is quick and easy. You should all create your first characters together at the beginning of your first session. Character creation is, just like play, a kind of conversation — and you can’t have a conversation when you are alone.
Pretty much everything you need to do is fill your character sheets. Come along, I’ll take you through each step.

# Step 1. Choose a class
Take a look and choose one that piques your interest:

- [Fighter](Fighter.md), the unstoppable war machine
- [Ranger](Ranger.md), who wanders the wild
- [Rogue](Rogue.md), the master of cloak and dagger
- [Sorcerer](Sorcerer.md), wielding power beyond comprehension
- [Sun-speaker](Sun.md-Speaker), the keeper of faith

# Step 2. Choose your blood
Most classes (with the exception of the Sun-Speaker) have several options for ***Blood***. They represent your heritage and ancestry and each gives you a special ability.

# Step 3. Choose your background
***Background*** is a reminder of who you were before you’ve taken on your new harsh and dangerous life. 

*Were you a soldier, or a scholar, or a hermit?* Think about it, and if you need some guidance, take a look at the list.

# Step 4. Choose your Passion
Life on the edge takes a toll on one’s mind. That’s why every hero needs a ***Passion*** — something they do to cope with their perilous lives, something they do to find peace.
Keep in mind, this choice isn’t final. As your own passion probably has changed over the course of your life, your character’s probably will too.

# Step 5. Come up with a name
Character’s name is important, of course. Just write down whatever you find fitting, but if you’re stuck don’t hesitate to just choose one from the list.

# Step 6. Choose a special ability
Take a look at the special abilities of your class. Choose one. If you can’t decide what to pick — just take the first on the list, it’d be a good “default” choice.

# Step 7. Assign four action dots
Each class comes with three action dots already placed. You get to add four more dots (so you’ll have seven total). At the start of the game, no action rating may have more than two dots.
