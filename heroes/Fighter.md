*"For no one - no one in this world can you trust. Not men, not women, not beasts...", — your father takes a sword from the forge and hands it to you, — "This. This you can trust."*

Where words fail, swords come to solve the problem. This is you. You are the Sword, you are the Shield, you are the Steel.  
**When you play a Fighter, you earn XP when you put your life on the line to defend the weak**. They won't survive without you.

# Special abilities
## Berzerk
When you see someone or something you hold dear in danger, you can mark2 Doom to enter a battle trance and possess extreme strength and resilience until things calm down.

> The GM will modify your position and effect accordingly when you fight in a battle trance. Also, you suffer two consequences: “Can’t Tell Friend From Foe” and
“Can’t Stop Until They’re All Broken.” You may resist these with your Mind.

## Blacksmith
When you work on improving your heirloom weapon through mundane or arcane means, you get +1 result level. You start with one improvement already in mind.

## Bonebreaker
When you Wreck an enemy with savage force, abandoning all sense of defense, treat 1-3 as 4/5.

> Basically, when you trade defense for offense, you are guaranteed to inflict some damage, but you’re still vulnerable to counterattacks. And be sure, they won’t pull their punches.

## Bonesetter
You can Tinker with bones, blood, and flesh to treat wounds or stabilize the dying. When you or your allies Recover and you treat them, they don’t have to spend a coin.

>Knowledge of anatomy and healing is a rare thing. Without this ability, any attempts at treatment are likely to fail or make things worse. You can use this ability to give first aid (rolling Tinker) to allow your patient to ignore a harm penalty for an hour or two.

## Riddle of Steel
Each implement of war has a spirit residing in it. Some are naive and wide-eyed, being forged yesterday, some are wise and old, having seen centuries of bloodshed. You may communicate with them. What kind of spirit possesses your weapon?
When you consult with the spirit that resides in your heirloom weapon, tell it a story of your own exploits, ask a question and the spirit will answer. Don’t count on them telling the truth, though. If you act on its advice, mark 1 xp. 

## Vigorous
Penalties from harm are one level less severe. Extreme harm is still incapacitating, though.

> With this ability, Grave harm doesn’t incapacitate you; instead you take -1d to your rolls (as if it was Moderate harm). Moderate harm affects you as if it were level 1 (less effect). Mild harm has no effect on you (but you still write it on your sheet, and must recover to heal it). Record the harm at its original level — for healing purposes, the original harm level applies.

## The Wall
When you put your life on the line to defend someone or something you hold dear, you act with increased effect.

# Blood
## Human
*There is a long and rich tradition of warrior-poets among humans, spanning centuries. And just like with their martial tradition, each warrior finds their own style. There are no rules to war, and what is poetry, if not war waged with words?*

Gain an additional passion: poetry. Also, when you try to find peace, roll the best attribute instead of the worst.

## Elf
*Elves have wandered the world far before the first human was even born. They’ve fought the Beasts since the dawn of time and their blacksmiths had plenty of time to perfect their craft.*

Your heirloom weapon has potency vs. Beasts.

## Dwarf
*Dwarves are sturdy and to surprise of both humans and elves, disturbingly nimble.*

When you Resist, roll +1D.

## Orc
*Strength and endurance of orcs is a thing of legends. It’s no surprise no one but them can survive at the highest peaks of the world.*

Your load limits are higher. Light: 5; Normal: 7; Heavy: 8.

# Dark gifts
## Barkskin
Your skin grows thicker and rougher, resembling the bark of ash-trees. When you resist physical harm, you can mark 1 Doom and negate it completely without rolling any dice.

## Terrifying presence
You invoke supernatural fear in beasts and men alike.

## King of Swords
Your voice is compelling to spirits residing in the arms of men. You can mark 2 Doom to make them answer you truthfully — or — lash out at their wielders — or —  turn to dust and ash.

## Beast
You succumb to the Darkness completely and become an NPC. Describe what horrifying form your former husk will take.
