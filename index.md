*The Men prospered in the incandescence of the Sun above, as Her light kept horrendous Beasts, spawns of the Dark at bay.
But at one point in time, so long ago that even the oldest of immortal elves don’t remember it, things have changed. The Sun above stopped to warm and started to burn Men and Beasts indiscriminately.
Whatever sin was committed, it was great and now you must suffer to repent it.
Or, at least, the Temple says so.*

This is the game of faith. This is the game of dangers, struggles, darkness, corruption. This is the game of heroism, self-sacrifice and friendship, forged in blood and fire.
Players take on roles of the heroes, risking their life at every turn to make sure that their world, or even the world at large lives to see another day.
